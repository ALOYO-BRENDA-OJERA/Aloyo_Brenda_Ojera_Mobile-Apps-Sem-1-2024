// 1.(a)
//  flutter is an open source mobile application development framework that is used to build high-performance mobile apps for android and ios.
// Types of applications built with flutter
// desktop applications
// mobile applications
// web applicvations
// game applications.


// 1.(b)
// advantages of using flutter
// fast development time due to use of hot reload feature.
// cross platform develpment, where you use the same code base and run it on multiple platforms
// Custom UI: Offers a wide range of pre-built widgets and allows customization
 
// 1.c
// Dart is an open source  object-oriented programming language developed by google, to create mobile applications.

// why dart is used in flutter
// -Dart's JIT compilation allows Hot Reload in Flutter, letting developers see changes instantly during development without losing the app state.
//  Optimized for UI Development

// - Dart's AOT compilation compiles Flutter apps into native machine code, ensuring high performance and near-native speed on both Android and iOS.
//   Unified Language

// - Dart can be used for both the UI layer and business logic in Flutter apps, eliminating the need for a bridge (like JavaScript bridges in React Native). This reduces latency and improves performance.
//   Declarative Programming Style

//  -Dart enables Flutter to build apps for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, web, and desktop) from a single codebase, with consistent performance and appearance.
//   Advantages of Dart in Flutter

// 1.(d)
// concept of hot reload
// Hot reload is a feature in flutterframe work that allows developers to see the changes they make 
//in the code almost instantly reflected in the running application without restarting it or losing the current state. 

// How it increases productivity
// Instant Changes: Developers see the effect of their code changes almost instantly, typically in less than a second.
// Faster Iteration: Allows developers to experiment with UI designs, layouts, and logic without restarting the app or waiting for it to recompile.
// Real-Time Testing: Developers can fix bugs and immediately verify whether the changes resolve the issue without restarting the app.

// 1.(e)
// Features of flutter that make it popular.
// -- Cross-Platform Development
// -- Hot reload
// --Widgets

// 1.(f)
// --stateless widget:
//Definition:
// A widget that does not require mutable state (data that can change during the widget's lifetime).
// It is immutable and rebuilt only when its parent widget changes.

// Example Use Case:
// Static UI Elements: When creating UI components that donâ€™t need to update dynamically.
// Example: A title bar, logo, or static text.


// stateful widget:
// Definition:
// A widget that holds mutable state (data that can change during the widget's lifetime).
// It is useful when the widget needs to update or react to user input or external data changes.
// Example Use Case:

// Dynamic UI Elements: When the widget updates based on user interactions or data changes.
// Example: A button that toggles between two states or a counter that increments when clicked.
